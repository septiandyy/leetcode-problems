# 🚀 LeetCode Problem List: Mastering Algorithms Across Languages

Welcome to the ultimate LeetCode solutions repository! 🎉 Here, we're not just solving problems; we're exploring the vast landscape of programming languages. From the classic to the cutting-edge, we're tackling LeetCode challenges in a whopping 11 languages!

## 🌈 Why So Many Languages?

Ever wondered how the same algorithm looks in different programming paradigms? Or how memory management varies across languages? This repo is your playground for cross-language exploration! 

Here's why each language made our star-studded lineup:

- **C**: The grandfather of modern programming. Master pointers and manual memory management!
- **C++**: C's object-oriented sibling. Perfect for when you need that extra performance boost.
- **C#**: Microsoft's jack-of-all-trades. Great for those diving into .NET ecosystems.
- **Java**: Write once, run anywhere. Ideal for enterprise-level, cross-platform development.
- **Python**: The Swiss Army knife of programming. Rapid prototyping and data science galore!
- **JavaScript**: The language of the web. Essential for any front-end developer.
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript with superpowers. Catch those pesky type errors before runtime!
- **Ruby**: Programming happiness in a gem. Enjoy beautiful, readable code.
- **Go**: Simplicity meets concurrency. Google's answer to modern, scalable software.
- **Rust**: Where safety meets performance. No more segmentation faults!
- **Dart**: Flutter's sidekick. Mobile app development has never been this smooth.
